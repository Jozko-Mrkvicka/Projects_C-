Cube3D
======

This is simple demonstration program to create 3D (wire-frame) cube.
This code creates 3D space. Inside of this space there is drawn a cube.
The cube can be translated and rotated. The projection plane is placed
to the beginning of the coordinate system and it is fixed. 
The cube is drawn only in front of the projection plane to a certain
distance. The drawing of the cube is limited also in width and height.

Motivation for this mini project was to utilize my knowledge from highschool
math classes and to gain better understanding/practice of the topic.
